# Transformer from Scratch

This repository contains an implementation of the Transformer model from the paper ["Attention is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). The goal of this project is to build the Transformer architecture from scratch, including all its components, and train it on a sequence-to-sequence task.

## Project Overview

The Transformer is a sequence-to-sequence model that relies entirely on attention mechanisms, without recurrent or convolutional layers. It consists of an encoder-decoder structure, where both components use multi-head self-attention and feed-forward neural networks. This project implements the Transformer architecture step by step, starting from the basic building blocks (e.g., positional encoding, scaled dot-product attention) to the full model.

### Key Features
- **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Implements the attention mechanism described in the paper.
- **Feed-Forward Networks**: Includes two-layer feed-forward networks with ReLU activation and dropout.
- **Residual Connections and Layer Normalization**: Ensures stable training and better gradient flow.
- **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**: Combines the encoder and decoder into a complete Transformer model.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Includes training loops, loss computation, and evaluation metrics.

### Dataset
[Placeholder: Describe the dataset you used for training and evaluation. For example, "This project uses the English-to-German translation dataset from the WMT'14 competition."]

### Results
[Placeholder: Add results such as BLEU scores, training/validation losses, or any other metrics you computed.]
